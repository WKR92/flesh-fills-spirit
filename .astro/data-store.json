You can call me **Rush**.\n\nIâ€™ve been writing for 20 years and running TTRPG sessions for several. Over time, Iâ€™ve accumulated a massive amount of material, and I figured it was time to **share it with others**. My only reward is knowing that someone enjoys it and finds value in what I create.\n\n---\n\n### **Why does this exist?**\n\nEvery Game Master eventually strives to craft a **system, world, or adventures** that best capture their vision. This project represents the **foundations** of my ideal game.\n\n#### **What makes it special?**\n\nâœ… **A dark, low-magic, mystical world** â€“ brutal, immersive, and filled with moral dilemmas.  \nâœ… **A survival-driven experience** â€“ pseudo-realism, scarcity, and tough choices define the gameplay.  \nâœ… **Fast and deadly mechanics** â€“ action is quick and dangerous but allows for strategic depth.  \nâœ… **Player-driven storytelling** â€“ the world reacts, choices matter, and consequences are real.  \nâœ… **Adventures that challenge the mind and morality** â€“ no simple hack-and-slash solutions.\n\nThis is a **dark, harsh, and engaging fantasy world**, breaking away from traditional genre conventions. While humor has its place, the intended tone is **serious and immersive**.\n\n---\n\n### **How does it play?**\n\nThe game mechanics are **simple but flexible**, allowing for creativity in problem-solving. Combat is **fast, dangerous, and strategic**, but **character progression remains meaningful**. Players grow, but never to the point where a lone warrior could fearlessly take on a group of ruthless cutthroats in a dark alley.\n\nAdventures are my **favorite part** of this project. This site exists **so more people can play them and share their thoughts**. I experiment with storytelling techniques, aiming to **ignite engagement and push boundaries**. These are never trivial tales where brute force is the only answer. Instead, they present players with **complex, morally challenging, and thought-provoking dilemmas**.\n\nAt the heart of everything is the belief that **story comes first** â€“ but it is a **story about the players**. **Narrative always takes precedence over mechanics**, and the world itself is **alive and ever-changing**.\n\n---\n\n### **Join the Journey!**\n\nðŸ“¥ **Download a free adventure and experience the world for yourself!**  \nðŸ’¬ **Tried my system?
