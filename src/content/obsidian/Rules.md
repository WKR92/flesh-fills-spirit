# Base

## For whom

**Haunted Matter** is for those who choose drama over simulation, story over mechanics, and player decisions over supernatural power. There are no levels, no classes, no builds, no flashy powers, no balance. There is risk, pseudo-realism, fluidity, minimalist rules, narrative thinking, and real consequences. It takes effort to learn, but it provides clear mechanics to keep the story grounded. This is a system for playing out a narrative.

Rules are tools, not scripture. Break them whenever it helps the story breathe. The GM decides — always — but in service of the fiction, not authority.

---

## Core Mechanics

- **Narrative first, mechanics second.** Say what you want to do; the GM decides whether it’s possible and what mechanics apply.
- All rolls use a pool of d6s.
- The number of dice = the level of the relevant **trait** (usually 1–4).
- **Main die** (in a distinct color):
    - **5–6**: The player can do something extra (for free), e.g. interrupt an effect in time (on a 6). On a 5, it costs **fatigue**.
    - **1–2**: The enemy can react with a bonus effect.
- The result of a roll is the **highest value** among all dice:
    - **6** – full success.
    - **4–5** – success with a cost (GM narrates consequences).
    - **1–3** – failure (GM narrates consequences).
- Minimum dice: 1. Maximum: 6 (unless stated otherwise).
- A player may roll **fewer** dice than their trait allows if they want.
- Helping another player: +1 die, the helper gains **fatigue**. Multiple helpers allowed (up to 6 total dice).
- Retrying the same task after failure costs **fatigue** (e.g. forcing a door, lockpicking).
- The GM can modify a roll (± dice) depending on the situation.
- If the test is **general** (e.g. scanning a field), max **2 players** can roll to prevent stat abuse.
- **Critical failure** (two or more 1s): automatic failure, gain **fatigue**.
- **Critical success** (two 6s): automatic success, gain 1d6 **fate**.
- **Fate**:
    - A pool of d6s the player can use at any time to try to alter the narrative (as long as it makes sense).
    - To succeed, at least one fate die must roll a 6.
    - You can use as many fate dice as you have, but can never hold more than **5**.
    - Earned on critical success or as a GM reward.

### Advantages & Disadvantages

- **Advantage**: +1 die to the roll. **Disadvantage**: –1 die.
- They stack and cancel (e.g. +2 and –1 = +1).
- If a disadvantage would remove your last die: roll 1 die, but **your maximum result is lowered by 1** (scales with penalty).
- **Enemies**:
    - **Disadvantage**: When the enemy deals damage, subtract 1 of the player's failure dice (lowest). Further penalties remove dice alternately: lowest, then highest, and so on. If no dice remain, subtract 2 damage from the base value.
    - **Advantage**: The enemy adds a failure die (value 2) to the player's damage pool. This can be reduced by armor like any other die.

### Destiny Points

- Every player starts with **1 destiny point**.
- If you die, you can spend it to miraculously survive — you’re unconscious but stable.
- Destiny points can be bought with **advancement points**.

### Madness Points

- Given by the GM for reckless actions, especially those that go against the character’s values.
- Each **madness point** adds **1d10** to all future rolls.
- Madness dice take **priority** over regular d6s:
    - **1 on any madness die** = critical failure, regardless of other results.
    - **10 on any madness die** = critical success, unless a madness die also shows a 1.
- At **5 madness points**, your character **loses their mind** and becomes GM-controlled.
- Recovery: **1 month of care** from a healer = –1 madness point (can be split into **4 weeks** at ¼ effect each).

### Chance of Rolling at Least One Six

|Dice|Probability (%)|
|---|---|
|1d6|**16.67%**|
|2d6|**30.56%**|
|3d6|**42.13%**|
|4d6|**51.77%**|
|5d6|**59.81%**|
|6d6|**66.51%**|

&nbsp;

---

## Traits

- **Physical** – melee combat, aiming, endurance, athletics, dexterity, sleight of hand (theft/lockpicking/trap disarming), stealth
- **Mental** – arcana (occult knowledge and magic), mind (also common knowledge), investigation (including detecting danger), nature, religion, willpower
- **Social** – intuition, deception, intimidation, performance, persuasion, influence (connections, social leverage)
- **Specializations** – perception, medicine, animal handling, survival, technology (also jury-rigging, lockpicking, trap disarming), herbalism

Each character has a defined level (1–4) in every trait and rolls that many dice when attempting a related action.

---

## HP, Inventory, and Fatigue

### **Slots**

- Each character has **10 shared slots** used for **HP**, **inventory**, and **fatigue**. These represent their total carrying capacity and vitality.
- **HP** refreshes after a scene, assuming appropriate conditions.
- Each point of **fatigue** occupies 1 slot — reducing both your HP and available carrying space. If there’s no free space, you must discard something. HP and carrying capacity blocked by **fatigue** do not recover until the fatigue is removed.

---

### **Fatigue**

- At **6+ fatigue**, you suffer **disadvantage**.
- At **10 fatigue**, roll for **critical damage** and receive:
    - **+1 madness point**
    - A **permanent trauma** (GM decides — e.g. phobia, hypersensitivity).
- You may take 2 **fatigue** after a roll to gain +1 die retroactively.
- Sources of fatigue: prolonged exertion, critical wounds, extreme conditions, magical effects, etc.

---

### **Rest**

- **Short rest (1h)**: –1 fatigue, **resets all powers**.
- **Long rest (8h)**: –5 fatigue, +1 **critical damage die**.
    - In dangerous places: group test of **survival** — on failure, only –3 fatigue.
- **Discomfort** (hunger, lack of sleep, freezing cold) prevents rest. Each morning spent in discomfort: +1 fatigue.

---

### **Inventory**

- **Small item**: ½ slot; **Regular**: 1 slot; **Large** (e.g. two-handed weapon, tower shield): 2 slots
- **Minor objects** (berries, coins): do not take up space.
- **Ammo / kits (e.g. lockpicks)**: 20 uses = 1 unit; track usage. Shares a slot with the matching ranged weapon.
- **Rations**:
    - **Large**: 1 slot, lasts 3 days
    - **Small**: ½ slot, lasts 1 day
- **Arcana**: take no space and cannot be lost.
- **Ranged weapons**: count together with their ammunition (they share a slot).

---

### **Item Upgrades**

- Items can be **upgraded** up to 3 times using exotic materials (e.g. hydra scales = +1 magic armor).
- **Upgrades are permanent** — they cannot be swapped out.

---

## Status Effects

- If a PC would receive a status they already have, roll for a different one. If the rerolled status is also already present, a **catastrophe** occurs instead — the PC suffers a **permanent injury** (e.g. loses a hand, an eye, an ear, suffers severe burns, etc.).
- **Statuses** are the main tool for weakening PCs beyond direct damage.
- Only **fatigue** and **statuses** have **lasting mechanical effects** on players. Everything else should either lead to or reinforce them.
- PCs should be **afraid of statuses**. They are **common**, **long-lasting**, and **hard to remove**.
- When used well, statuses reinforce the tone of a **brutal, pseudo-realistic world**, where **failures carry real consequences**, and every decision can have a lasting cost.
- Enemies **do not suffer fatigue or statuses**. If an enemy would gain either, they instead take 2 automatic damage. However, they **can** suffer **conditions**.

---

### **Physical Statuses**

1. **WEAKENED** – **Disadvantage** on all **physical trait** rolls.
2. **WOUNDED** – Any partial success or failure causes you to gain 1 **fatigue**.
3. **MAULED** – Your injuries are severe. Each time you take damage, add 1 **automatic damage**.
4. **SORE** – Each failure on a **physical trait** roll adds 1 **fatigue**.
5. **SHOCKED** – You cannot benefit from armor.
6. **CUT OPEN** – Every rolled 1 lowers the highest result in your dice pool by 1. Altered dice **don’t count** toward criticals.

---

### **Mental Statuses**

1. **SENSITIVE** – You take **double fatigue** from any source.
2. **JITTERY** – **Disadvantage** on all **social trait** rolls.
3. **HALLUCINATING** – You cannot achieve full successes.
4. **DISTRACTED** – **Disadvantage** on all **mental trait** rolls.
5. **BROKEN** – You can’t roll more than 2 dice, regardless of the test.
6. **UNCERTAIN** – A result of 4 counts as a failure.

---

## Damage

### **Dealing Damage**

- Every character has **1 base damage**.
- Each **success** (4–6) on an attack roll (melee, ranged, or magic) deals **2 damage**.

---

### **Enemy Attacks**

- PCs take: **1 + the number of failures** from their own roll (these dice count “against” them).
- Enemies attack rationally — targeting the greatest threat.
- A single enemy can deal at most:  
    **their combat trait level + their base damage**, based on enemy type:
    - Weak (2), Moderate (3), Strong (4), Boss (5).
- If the number of failures exceeds the enemy’s trait, remove dice in order: **lowest → highest → lowest...** until it matches their trait value.
- **Strong enemies** deal 2 base damage. **Bosses** deal 3.
- **Groups**: base damage equals the number of members (or the strongest one, if mixed).

---

### **Special Cases**

- **Armor Penetration X**: X successes always deal damage. Armor only blocks the remaining ones.
- **Unavoidable Damage**: Cannot be blocked or reduced by any means.

---

### **HP and Recovery**

- HP represents your ability to avoid damage — not actual wounds.
- HP fully refreshes after a scene if you rest.
- HP blocked by **fatigue** does **not** recover.
- **Temporary HP** lasts until the end of the scene and does not refresh.
- Dropping below 0 HP triggers a **critical damage roll**.

---

### **Critical Damage**

- Actual physical injuries.
- You roll your **critical damage dice**:
    - **6**: no effect.
    - **4–5**: gain +3 **fatigue** (max 9), lose 1 **critical damage die**, and remain standing.
    - **1–3**: everything from the partial‐success result, but you fall unconscious. If nobody heals you before your next turn → you die. Out of combat → only one person may attempt your rescue. In both cases they must get a full success on a **Medicine** test.
- Critical damage dice return after a **week of rest**.

---

### **Crushing Damage**

- If you take more damage from a single source than your **maximum HP**, you suffer **disadvantage** on your **critical damage roll**.

---

### **Falling Damage**

- **Low fall** (up to 1 story):  
    → roll a **random physical status**.
- **Moderate fall** (2–3 stories):  
    → roll a physical status, take **1d12 damage**.
- **High fall** (4+ stories):  
    → roll a physical status, take **1d20 damage**.

---

### **Area Damage**

- Always roll **at least 2 dice**. If your trait only gives 1, you still roll 2 (even with disadvantage).
- Damage from successes must be **spread across all valid targets**:
    - Each success = 2 damage.
    - First, assign 1 success per enemy in range.
    - Any remaining successes can be assigned freely among already-hit targets.
- If there aren’t enough enemies, and **an ally is in range**, excess successes must **hit the ally**.
- Against **organized groups** (one unit representing several), you can assign **any number** of successes.

---

### **Damage Types**

- **Physical**
- **Magical / Elemental**

All can be blocked by armor.  
An attack can only deal **one type** of damage.

---

### **Resistances & Vulnerabilities**

**Resistance** to a damage type:  
Always allows you to remove 1 failure die when calculating incoming damage of that type.

**Vulnerability** to a damage type:  
Adds 1 artificial failure (value 3) when calculating damage from that type. This die **can** be blocked by armor and affects only damage, nothing else.

**Immunity** means complete negation of that damage type — extremely rare (e.g. immunity to poison or disease).

---

### **Scars**

When a PC's HP hits exactly **zero**, they receive a **scar** — roll on the Scar Table.  
You can’t get more than 1 scar per combat.

**Scar Table – All effects stack. Roll 1d6. Describe a scar on your body.**

| #   | Effect                                                                                                                |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Your bones are weakened — permanently lose 1 base damage unless you undergo a month of rehabilitation with a surgeon. |
| 2   | Your body is wrecked — permanently gain 1 fatigue unless treated as above.                                            |
| 3   | You're battered — permanently lose 1 **critical damage die** unless treated as above.                                 |
| 4   | Scar tissue hardens your skin — permanently gain +1 max HP/fatigue/invetory slot.                                     |
| 5   | You’ve been through enough to learn — gain **2 advancement points**.                                                  |
| 6   | You should be dead — gain **1 destiny point** and **1 madness point**.                                                |

## Weapons and Armor

### **Weapons**

#### **Specialization**

- There are 7 weapon types: **one-handed**, **two-handed**, **dual wield**, **bows**, **crossbows**, **thrown**, **firearms**.
- A character starts with **2 specializations**. More can be bought with **advancement points**.
- **Without specialization**: each success deals **–1 damage** (minimum 1).

---

#### **Melee Weapons**

- **One-handed** (e.g. sword, mace):
    - You can hold a **shield**, **light source**, or **utility item** in the other hand.
    - **Dual wielding one-handed weapons**:
        - **+1 die (advantage)** to melee attack rolls.
        - **–1 from the highest die result** in the pool.
- **Two-handed** (e.g. axe, maul):
    - Each success deals **3 damage** instead of 2.

---

#### **Ranged Weapons**

- Can attack into **other zones**.
- Shooting from horseback = **disadvantage**.
- Reloading costs 1 **fatigue**.

|Weapon|Rules|
|---|---|
|**Shortbow**|No penalty when shooting from horseback; doesn’t reveal your position if hidden|
|**Bow**|You can split your successes across multiple targets|
|**Crossbow**|On a 1–2 on the main die, you must reload; success = 3 damage; armor penetration 1|
|**Light Crossbow**|Reloads on a 1 on the main die; armor penetration 1|
|**Repeating Crossbow**|Reload after 3 shots; armor penetration 1|
|**Hand Crossbow**|Can be used with a melee weapon; 1 zone range; counts as melee **or** ranged attack; doesn’t reveal your position if hidden|
|**Musket**|On a 1 on the main die, gain the STUNNED condition; on 1–2, must reload; success = 3 damage; armor penetration 2|
|**Pistol**|Can be used with a melee weapon; reloads on a 1 on the main die; counts as melee **or** ranged attack|

&nbsp;

---

#### **Unarmed & Improvised Weapons**

- **Unarmed**: 1 damage per success (more only with the **Monk** power).
- **Improvised weapons**: don’t require specialization, but deal **–2 base damage**.  
    If the first attack is a **full success** and the enemy is **not powerful**, they fall unconscious.

---

#### **Conditions on Hit**

- If the **main die** shows:
    - **5–6** (for PCs)
    - **1–2** (for enemies)  
        → you may apply a **condition** (e.g. _bleeding_) if your weapon allows it.
- The player must **track** which enemies are affected — the effect is resolved at the start of their turns.

---

### **Armor**

#### **Physical Armor**

- Armor lets you discard failure dice from your own attack roll, reducing incoming enemy damage.
- It also blocks base and environmental damage (e.g. magical beams).
- **Limit**: 4 damage blocked per point of armor.
- **Max 6 physical armor**.

#### **Magical Armor**

- Increases the max failure dice you can block from 6 to **10**.
- Also protects against **mental, internal, and intangible damage**.
- Doesn’t impose penalties.
- Only available via **arcana or exotic materials**.
- **Max 4 magical armor**.

#### **Armor Recovery**

- After resting (end of a scene), a PC may revover all points of armor.
- **Temporary armor**: lasts until the end of the combat.

---

#### **Armor Penalties**

- **Agility**: applies to rolls involving **dexterity, stealth, sleight of hand**, and some **athletics** (e.g. swimming, climbing), or **magic/nature** requiring hand gestures. GM decides logically.
- **Visibility**: affects **perception** and **aiming** rolls.
- Penalty = **–1 to your highest die** for affected rolls (per penalty point).

---

#### **Types of Armor**

|Type|Armor|Penalty|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Light**|+1|—|—|
|**Medium**|+2|–1 to **agility**|—|
|**Heavy**|+3|–2 to **agility**|Takes 2 slots|
|**Helmet**|+1|–1 to **visibility**|—|
|**Small Shield**|+1|–1 to **agility**|Takes 1 slot. Can be **sacrificed** to:  <br>– reduce damage by 4  <br>– avoid a condition or status|
|**Large Shield**|+2|–1 to **agility** and **visibility**|Takes 2 slots. Can be **sacrificed** to:  <br>– reduce damage by 6  <br>– avoid a condition or status|

&nbsp;

## Powers (Specialities)

- Using a **power** costs 1 **fatigue**, unless stated otherwise.
- Using a **power** takes up your turn.

---

### **List of Powers**

- **Medic** – You tend to an ally (not yourself), healing them for 1d4 or removing 1 fatigue. Can’t be used to trade fatigue between healers.
- **Mobile** – You move safely through hazardous terrain (e.g. climbing, rubble) or past enemies; also lets you escape a grapple.
- **Precise** – Your next attack ignores the target’s armor. Cannot be used with two-handed weapons.
- **Protector** – You take the effect, status, or damage meant for an adjacent ally.
- **Armored** – Restore up to 4 points of armor.
- **Supportive** – Grant an ally **double advantage** (+2d6 to their next roll).
- **Stealthy** – You appear unnoticed within line of sight. This is not teleportation and does not bypass terrain.
- **Experienced** – After your action, perform a **free maneuver** (grapple, disarm, trip, etc.).
- **Controlling** – After your action, you can **freely affect the environment** (flip a table, use a tool, light a torch, etc.).
- **Marksman** – You hit any visible target in range. It can't be a lethal shot.
- **Brutal** – Each enemy hit in this action takes **+1 damage**.
- **Enchanter** – Manipulate an existing element (not create one) like fire, shadow, wind, or water to cause a **single narrative effect** (e.g. block a path, knock someone down). Requires at least 1 rank in **magic** or **nature**.
- **Unshaken** – Ignore all statuses and conditions until the end of the scene or your next failed roll.
- **Awakened** – Cast a spell **without a bonus and without cost**, even if you don’t meet the usual requirements. Treat as if you had rank 2 in the trait. Costs **2 fatigue**.
- **Tracker** – Instantly find a trail if one is present.
- **Undying** – Reroll one critical damage die.
- **Silent** – Your next action does not reveal your location.
- **Commander** – Let an ally make a **free move or maneuver**.
- **Saboteur** – Successfully sabotage the environment (set a trap, block a passage, hang a curtain, etc.).
- **Scout** – Learn something **useful and visible** about the scene.
- **Hexer** – Turn an ally’s failure into a **partial success**.
- **Thief** – Steal or grab a **small** item within arm’s reach without being noticed, even in tense situations.
- **Trapper** – Set a trap or ambush **even during combat or escape**, as long as it makes sense.
- **Unyielding** – Ignore any effect that would knock you down, push, pull, pin, or restrain you.
- **Actor** – Invent a false identity or story that everyone **believes as true**, until it's directly challenged.
- **Threatening** – Force obedience from a **non-key NPC** through sheer intimidation.
- **Sign** – Leave a **hidden message** that’s readable only by those it’s meant for.
- **Collector** – Reveal a **small, non-magical item** that you could plausibly have had on you all along.
- **Slayer** – If your next attack hits, the target also gains the **FEARFUL** condition.
- **Peacemaker** – A **non-key enemy** becomes open to negotiation.
- **Shieldbearer** – Sacrifice your shield to protect an adjacent ally, following the usual shield rules.
- **Seer** – Ask the GM one question about the near future of this scene (e.g. _"What happens if we stay here?"_, _"Will someone betray us?"_). The GM must answer truthfully, within the fiction.
- **Hidden** – You can stay hidden even after interacting with another creature.
- **Bastion** – For one round, you are **immune to damage and statuses**, but cannot attack.
- **Shaman** – You can sense **souls, magic, or corruption** in the scene, even without an obvious source.
- **Distraction** – You create a brief distraction (shout, whistle, crash) that **redirects attention for 1 turn** from a chosen target.
- **Monk** – Your **unarmed attacks** deal 2 damage per success (permanently, no fatigue cost). You can also **run along walls**, but not stop on them (doing so costs 1 fatigue).

---

## Magic

### **Fictional Assumptions**

- Magic is **rare, unwanted, and illegal**, known only to a few (priests, warlocks).
- Wizards are nearly extinct, and rituals require **multiple participants**.
- Magic is seen as **disturbing and unknowable** – most people’s understanding of it is distorted or superstitious.
- PCs casting spells must **justify it narratively** and **hide it** when possible.
- **Scrolls** can be cast by anyone, **without a roll**.
- **Scrolls and potions** are rare — they can’t be bought at markets, only found or crafted.

---

### **Spellcasting Mechanics**

- Magic is a form of **power**. Casting a spell costs **1 fatigue**.
- Roll **arcana** or **nature**, with **advantage**.
- GM and player decide on the spell’s parameters. Each step above base costs 1 extra success:
    - **Scale**: self (0) • one target (1) • group (2) • whole scene (3)
    - **Complexity**: simple (0) • demanding (3 dmg per success) (1) • extreme (4 dmg per success) (2)
    - **Duration**: turn/scene (0) • hour (1) • day (2) • whole session (3)
- If you roll fewer successes than needed, you may **lower the spell’s parameters** as desired.
- **Roll outcomes**:
    - **Full success**: +1 bonus success.
    - **Partial success**: –1 success from the pool (if you had more than one).
    - **Failure**: spell fails, and you gain +1 **fatigue**.
- **Religion** instead of arcana/nature:
    - No fatigue cost, but requires a **full success** and never grants the bonus success.
- Your spells **do not harm you**, but can harm allies.
- The GM can **deny any spell effect** that’s implausible, regardless of rolls.
- **Enemy magic** has no HP or fatigue cost.

---

### **Side Effects**

#### **Magical Catastrophe**

If you roll **three 1s**, trigger the **Magical Catastrophe Table**, no matter the modifiers.

|#|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|You curse 100 square kilometers with a blight chosen by the GM.|
|2|You summon a powerful divine agent (random deity) that appears next to you.|
|3|Everyone in your zone takes **4d6 unavoidable damage** as reality tears apart.|
|4|A massive earthquake devastates 100 square kilometers: buildings collapse, trees are uprooted, waters flood.|
|5|100 square kilometers are shrouded in black clouds for a month: darkness, cold, crop failure.|

#### **Corruption Clock**

- A **critical failure** (two 1s) advances the **Corruption Clock**.
- At stage 4, the PC undergoes permanent mutation:
    1. –1 **persuasion** or **influence** (visible physical change)
    2. –1 armor (permanent)
    3. –1 HP/fatigu/inventory slot
    4. –2 advancement points (or take –2 if you have none)
    5. +1 madness point
    6. You may make a small magical effect permanent — discuss details with the GM
        

---

#### **Social Clock**

- Casting spells **in front of ordinary people** advances the **Social Clock**.
- At level 3, the party loses 1 point of **reputation** with the local faction.
- The clock can be **reset** by doing that faction a meaningful favor.

#### **Optional — How Magic Works — GM Eyes Only**

Don’t read this unless you’re the GM — it’s a spoiler for how the world works.

In the world of **Zaya**, everything — people, stones, even air — contains a **soul**. A soul is a mindless force journeying through all forms of existence until it returns to the **Pillar of Being**, expanding the world’s space. Souls **shape reality** itself.

Magic rips souls out of their forms and forces them to obey the caster’s will. Very few can do this. On a large scale, it causes **matter to corrupt**. Almost no one, including mages, understands how it truly works — this is one of the world’s great secrets.

**Arcana (magic items)** are things accidentally inhabited by lost souls. Most people don’t realize it, but **arcana are haunted**.

---

### **Giving Arcana to Players**

Arcana are a major source of power.

When a player or GM creates an **arcana**, the item should enable **narrative choices**, not just mechanical boosts.  
Use **fatigue** as the cost for stronger effects. Most arcana should have **limited uses** or **conditions for renewal**.

---

#### **Example Arcana**

**Golden Collar of Voices**  
Worn in the helmet slot. An ornate gold necklace covering the throat.

Spend 2 **fatigue** to replicate the voice of any creature you’ve heard. Roll 3 dice of **deception** to convince listeners. Doesn’t work if they can see you.

- **Full success**: Everyone believes the voice is real.
- **Partial success**: Half the audience believes it. They may split up to investigate. You gain **advantage** on further social rolls against believers.

---

**Warhammer of Vigor**  
If you hit with at least 3 successes, you’re filled with power — remove 1 **fatigue**.  
If you have **0 fatigue**, you gain **advantage on endurance** tests.

While wielding this weapon, you seem agitated — gain **disadvantage on persuasion and influence** rolls.

---

**Hundred Mirages**  
A cloak. Once per long rest, you may use the **Actor** power **without fatigue cost**.

---

## Combat

### **General Rules**

- TL;DR: When you attack, one roll determines everything: whether you hit — if you have at least one 4+; how much damage you deal — the number of successes (dice showing 4+); and how much damage you take on a partial success or failure — the number of failures (dice showing 1–3) as the enemy’s response. If you roll three dice and get one 4 and two 2s, you hit the enemy with one success and they hit you with two. One point of armor negates one enemy failure die; with three armor you can block up to three such dice in that exchange.

---


- Combat happens either in **theater of the mind** or on a **zone grid**. It should stay fast and narrative-driven.
- The battlefield is divided into **zones**—each zone represents a space like a corridor, room, or part of one. Moving from one zone to another takes one move. Each additional zone = one extra move. There are no distances within zones: if you're in the same zone, you can reach any opponent in melee.
- **No initiative** – players act in order of **Dexterity + Perception – Fatigue**. If surprised, players must roll a **defensive test against danger** at the start.
- **Enemies don’t have turns** – they act only **in reaction** to player actions.
    - On a **partial success or failure**, their reaction succeeds.
    - On a **full success**, their attempt fails.
- There are **no defined actions**. You describe what you want to do, and the GM rules on whether it’s possible and what mechanics apply. The system assumes you act because you had the idea, not because it’s printed on your sheet.
- A PC can typically **move and take one action** per turn. You may move **double distance** if you do nothing else that turn.
- You can **draw or switch weapons/items once per turn** for free.
- Using an item (like a potion) **uses up your turn**.
- You may **ready an action** in response to a specific trigger (e.g., “I strike if someone steps through the doorway.”)
- A **group** is a cluster of enemies acting as one unit for narrative clarity. If the group outnumbers the PCs or attacks from a safe range, their **base damage equals the number of members**, or the highest among them if applicable.
- Instead of attacking, you can attempt **maneuvers** (e.g., blind, knockdown, shove). Repeating the same maneuver on the same target in consecutive turns = **disadvantage**. Maneuvers against **larger enemies** = **disadvantage**.
- Maximum range of a **ranged weapon** = number of **Aiming** trait levels. Thrown weapons reach **1 zone beyond your own**. You can’t throw further. Throwing a **non-ranged** weapon = always roll just 1d6.
- **Buying effects with successes**: If you score **multiple successes**, you may spend **1 fatigue per effect** to gain something extra (e.g., free maneuver, movement, item use).
- **Huge creatures** deal damage to **all nearby targets** and **can’t be affected by maneuvers**.
- **Sustained effects** (e.g. concentration, flying, mounted combat) may break if:
    - **Main die** = 6 → effect ends.
    - **Main die** = 5 → effect ends unless the user pays **1 fatigue**.

---

### **Hiding in Combat**

- Roll **Stealth**:
    - 6 = gain **HIDDEN** condition.
    - 4–5 = gain **HIDDEN** by paying 1 fatigue.  
        Refusing = no effect, continue your turn.
    - 1–3 = fail; trigger a **soft reaction** from the enemy.
- You **can’t hide in plain sight** – you must describe a logical cover.  
    The GM can veto it if the terrain offers no concealment.
- If you're in a zone with enemies, you roll **with disadvantage**.
- Hidden state lasts **successes + 1 turns**.  
    Ends early if you **interact with someone** (attack, touch, use a power).  
    You may pay **1 fatigue** before acting to **keep the condition**.

---

### **Powerful Enemies & Bosses**

- Monsters are rare but terrifying.  
    At the start of combat with one, roll **Will**:
    - Partial success = gain **1 fatigue**.
    - Failure = gain **FEARFUL** condition.
- Entering a boss’s zone often requires a **defensive roll**.
- Bosses:
    - **Base damage: 3**
    - **3 critical damage dice**
    - Count as **5+ enemies** in one zone
    - **Immune to conditions**, unless:
        - Player rolls a **5–6 on main die**, or
        - Rolls a **4 and pays 1 fatigue**

---

### **Morale**

- When a **commander dies**, or enemies drop **below half**, or one loses all HP, they roll a **group Will test**. On failure = **surrender or flee**.
- If only one (non-boss) enemy remains, they **always surrender**, unless a suicide charge makes narrative sense.
- Morale exists to **end dragging fights** — use it consistently.

---

### **Conditions**

- **BLINDED/DEAFENED** – Melee attacks use only 1 die; can’t make ranged attacks. Affected sense is disabled. Usually lasts 2 turns.
- **BLEEDING/POISONED/BURNING** – Roll **Endurance** at the start of your turn.
    - Full success = remove condition.
    - Lasts until end of scene.
    - Outside combat = 2 fatigue or 1d12 damage.
- **FRIGHTENED** – Can’t approach the fear source. **Disadvantage** on tests vs it. If in same zone = must flee. Usually lasts 2 turns.
- **CHARMED** – Doesn’t affect monsters. Requires **Will** test each turn. If you’ve charmed someone, you may command them, as long as it doesn’t violate their values.
- **SLOW/FAST** – Usually lasts 2 turns - On movement:
    - **SLOW** = disadvantage.
    - **FAST** = extra move or **advantage**. 
- **GRAPPLING** – You drag the target with **disadvantage** to your attacks. You can release them anytime.
- **GRAPPLED/ENTANGLED** – Can’t move; enemies have **advantage** against you. Roll **Athletics** to escape.
- **DAZED** – You lose your turn. Every action against you is a full success and every damage die against you deals +3 damage.
- **PRONE** – Roll **Melee/Dexterity** to stand. Actions on the ground have **disadvantage** (unless attacker is also prone). Attacks against you have **advantage**.
- **DISARMED** – Every damage die against you deals +1 damage. Roll **Melee/Dexterity** to pick up your weapon.
- **INVISIBLE/HIDDEN** – Can’t be targeted by non-physical ranged attacks.  
    Attacked with **Perception**.  
    Gain **advantage** to your attacks.  
    Ends if you interact with others (e.g. attack).

---

### **Organized Groups**

Special enemy units represented by **one marker per zone**. They don’t follow normal group rules.

#### **Squad**

- 15 HP, 3 armor, 5 members.
- Use 3d6 for any traits (e.g., Endurance).
- Base damage: 2 (2 damage per success).
- Every **3 HP lost = 1 member killed** (can happen in a single action). After 3 members die, players may pay **1 fatigue** to force the rest to flee. If they stay, reduce rolls to **2d6**.
- Can’t be bypassed. **No maneuvers** allowed.

#### **Mob**

- 7 members. 14 HP, 2 armor.
- Every **2 HP lost = 1 member dies**.
- Use 2d6 for traits.
- After 5 deaths, they **always flee**.
- Can’t be bypassed.

#### **Swarm**

- 15 members. 15 HP, 1 armor.
- Every **1 HP lost = 1 member dies**.
- Use 2d6 for traits.
- After 10 deaths, they **always flee**.
- If at **10+ HP**, any PC ending their turn in the zone must roll **Endurance** or gain **fatigue or physical status**.

---

### **Equipment Breakage**

When a PC rolls **three identical failures** (e.g. three 3s), roll 1d6 on the table below.  
Applies in addition to normal consequences. Affected gear is damaged **until repaired**.  
**Arcana** can be damaged like any other item.

|d6|Type|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|1|Weapon|First 3 successes no longer count.|
|2|Weapon|First 2 successes no longer count.|
|3|Weapon|First success no longer counts.|
|4|Armor|Lose 2 armor (including magical).|
|5|Armor|Lose 3 armor.|
|6|Armor|Lose 4 armor.|

&nbsp;

---

### **Enemy Reactions (GM Guidelines)**

- Enemy reacts **after** the PC’s action. If that enemy dies, another reacts (GM picks based on logic).
- On PC’s roll:
    - **6** → Enemy may **move and fail** an action (narratively).
    - **4–5** → Enemy performs a **soft move** (e.g., damage, maneuver, force defense roll).
    - **1–3** → Enemy makes a **hard move** (e.g., status, big attack, or **two soft moves**).
- **Soft move**: light consequence that can’t be resisted. **Hard move**: serious threat that can be resisted.
- Example: PC rolls 4 → deals damage → enemy attempts a hard move (status). PC rolls **Will**:
    - 6 = avoids effect
    - 4–5 = takes status **or** damage
    - 1–3 = takes **both**
- Enemies don’t have full stats. Use defaults:
    - **Regular** (e.g. guard, wolf): 2 dice, 6–8 HP
    - **Strong** (e.g. knight, elite): 3 dice, 10–12 HP
    - **Boss** (e.g. demon, general): 4 dice, 15–20 HP
- You may give special enemies **one unique ability**, e.g.:
    - _Can pass through walls – reset_
    - _Walks on walls and ceilings_
    - _Immune to fire_
    - _Each damage die healed 1 HP_

---

**Sample Enemy**:  
**The Hunger of Butchery (Boss)**

- HP: 18–20 | Damage: 3 (teeth and claws, armor penetration 1) | 2 moves
- Traits: 4 dice | Armor: 4
- Special: Every damage die heals 1 HP.
- Behavior: Skinless wolf-like creature with no eyes, only nostrils. Smells blood and fatigue. Twitches uncontrollably. Mimics the voices of those it devours. Shakes with ecstasy when something dies nearby.

---

## Character

### **Advancement**

At the end of each session, you gain **2 advancement points** (unless the GM rules otherwise).

|Advancement|Cost|
|---|---|
|Trait level 1|1|
|Trait level 2|2|
|Trait level 3|4|
|Trait level 4|6|
|New active power|4|
|Replace a power|2|
|+1 critical damage die|4|
|+1 destiny point|5|
|+1 slot (HP/inventory/fatigue capacity)|5|
|New weapon specialization|2|
|Immunity to one chosen status (can only be bought once)|4|
|New language|3|

- Spending **advancement points** means **6 + 1d8 days** of downtime in a city, regardless of how many points you spend. This is handled as a **group downtime**.
- **Traits** cap at level 4.
- You gain **+1 advancement point** whenever you fail a roll and get **at least three matching dice**, e.g. three 1s.
- GMs may grant extra points for major campaign milestones, but **no more than 3 at once**.
- These costs assume a campaign lasting up to one year of weekly sessions. If the game continues longer, reduce advancement gain to **1 per session after session 20**.

# Advanced rules

## Moves

- **Moves** are mechanics meant to streamline interaction between PCs and the GM.
- If the GM isn’t sure what cost a PC should pay for a partial success, they pay an appropriate amount of **fatigue**.
- The GM has final say and may adjust these outcomes for the sake of the narrative.
- Treat these as optional tools—use whatever works best in the moment.

---

### **I Act in Secret** – **Stealth**

When PCs have broken in somewhere and are operating inside, each failure collects 2 “attention points” and each partial success collects 1. When they reach X points, someone notices them.

---

### **I Sneak Around** – **Stealth**

A PC tries to move unseen or hide from enemies.
- **Partial success**: pay 1 **fatigue** (or more if the GM rules hiding is very difficult), or you’re detected.

---

### **I Operate from the Shadows** – **Deception**

Spend “operation points” to act before time runs out.
- **Full success**: 3 points.
- **Partial success**: 2 points.  
    Each point lets you perform one micro-action (e.g. read a document unnoticed, steal a letter, grab a cloak). PCs can’t exceed the limit—“natural authority” (instinct to survive) prevents it. If the GM allows it, they must immediately introduce a consequence.

---

### **I Steal** – **Sleight of Hand**

- **Partial success**: you fail to steal the item but remain undetected—you can’t retry unless you pay 1 **fatigue**.
- **Full success**: you steal without notice but lose 1 reputation, advance the Social Clock, and gain 3 **fatigue**.

---

### **I Recall Information** – Appropriate Knowledge Trait (**Mind, Arcana, Nature**, etc.)

When a PC wants to check lore—religious ritual, monster, historical figure, special formula, etc.
- **Full success**: gain 3 lore points.
- **Partial success**: gain 1 lore point and may buy 1 more for 1 **fatigue**. 
- For each lore point, ask the GM one question; their answer is in‐character knowledge. Questions must fit the situation.
- Two PCs can make this open test; if both earn points they ask different questions.

**Sample questions:**
- Do I know this creature/place/object?
- What makes it unique?
- Who or what is connected to it?
- How does it work?
- How might I use it?
- Does it have weaknesses or limits?
- What dangers does it pose?
- Are there legends or superstitions?
- Who else might know more?
- Is this common knowledge or secret?
- What rules or laws govern it?
- Known defenses against it?
- Have others tried to use/destroy/understand it? What happened?

---

### **I Uncover the Scene** – **Perception/Survival/Investigation/Nature/Mind**

When a PC examines a specific situation—tracking footprints, inspecting a fresco, studying a curse.
- **Full success**: gain 3 insight points.
- **Partial success**: gain 1 point, may buy 1 more for 1 **fatigue**. 
- For each point, ask the GM one question; the answer is in‐character knowledge. Questions must fit the situation.
- Two PCs can make this open test and ask different questions if both succeed.

**Sample questions:**
- Who passed through here?
- How far am I from my quarry?
- What happened here?
- What stands out?
- Is there anything that threatens me?
- Anything useful?
- How long ago did it occur?
- Evidence of struggle, flight, or haste?
- Anything hidden or concealed?
- Any patterns, symbols, or markings?
- Can I tell where someone went or came from?
- Unusual smells or sounds?
- What doesn’t fit the environment?

---

### **I Get Someone to Act for Me** – **Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation/Influence**

- PCs explain how they leverage the chosen trait against the target.
- Without specific leverage, roll with **disadvantage**. Leverage examples: key info, official authority.
- Targets who belong to **dominant** or **privileged** power gain additional **disadvantage**.
- **Full or partial success** + 1 **fatigue** (or more if the target is resistant or circumstances are unfavorable): force the target to do one of the following (GM decides what best serves the story):
    - Stop where they are.
    - Halt their action.
    - Forgo an intended action.
    - Surrender (costs 3 **fatigue**; doesn’t work on powerful foes or organized groups).
    - Stay in place.
    - Perform a simple task (move something, act as bait).
    - Retreat quickly.
    - Attack you (costs 2 **fatigue**; GM decides if narratively appropriate).

- **Partial success**: PC suggests an outcome, but GM picks whatever best serves the narrative:
    - No change, no consequences.
    - Target agrees but demands 3 **fatigue** and Social Clock shifts (PC may refuse).
    - Partial change—GM describes what changes (e.g. “The cultist now thinks sacrificing the mayor’s child is wrong, but still wants another victim.”).
- **Failure**: GM decides on immediate consequences and any reputation or Social Clock effects.

---

### **I Know Someone Here** – **Influence**

If it’s plausible a PC could know someone in this location (PC can argue plausibility), they make a roll to see if that contact can help with the current problem.

- Creative roleplay can earn **advantage**.
- Questions/orders reset only when the entire deception ends.

---

    - You win over part of the audience—GM describes a new opportunity.
    - Target demands more proof.
    - You fail but without penalty.
    - You spend 2 **fatigue** to improvise a plausible detail that convinces the target (for harmless lies).
- **Failure**: immediate consequences plus possible Social Clock or reputation shifts.

---

- Current **fatigue** doesn’t apply (adrenaline surge).
- **Partial success**: you succeed but gain 5 **fatigue** and a physical or mental status (GM call).

- The GM may substitute narrative-appropriate penalties.

---

### **I Seduce** – **Persuasion/Influence/Performance/Deception**

PCs attempt a one-night liaison for pleasure or gain (longer bonds use downtime moves)
- GM sets **disadvantage** based on target’s social rank: dominant (3), privileged (2), executive (1), plus circumstances.
- **Full success**: A night together and potentially one key piece of info or a favor, if GM allows. PC is occupied for at least 4 in-world hours.
- **Partial success**: arouses interest and may yield one minor piece of info (GM decision).
- **Failure**: immediate consequences and possible Social Clock or reputation shifts.

---

### **I See Through You** – **Intuition**

PCs try to detect lies or hidden motives.
- **Full success**: you know the NPC hid something and gain **advantage** on your next social test to uncover it.
- **Partial success**: GM chooses one:
    - You know they’re hiding something but suffer **disadvantage** on your next social test.
    - You get one minor clue from the GM (e.g. body language tells you they resent you).
    - GM confirms deception but not details.
    - GM reveals a fact without context (e.g. “You’re sure he beat his child, but not how or why.”).
    - Partial info (e.g. “You suspect he had a letter from the baron but can’t prove it.”).
- **Failure**: you believe they’re telling the whole truth.

---

### **I Traverse Difficult Terrain** – **Athletics/Survival/Dexterity**

Use when climbing slippery rock, forcing your way through enemies, crossing brambles or mud, etc. Choose the fitting trait.
- **Partial success**: pay 1 + 1 per failure beyond your successes in **fatigue**, or treat as failure.
- Use this move **outside combat**. In a fight, partial success should simply provoke an enemy reaction.

---

### **I Steer** – **Animal Handling/Technology**

When controlling a vehicle or mount in a risky maneuver (e.g. jerking reins to tip a wagon), break the action into steps:
1. Command the beast to tip the wagon.
2. Aim to topple it onto foes or create cover.
3. Avoid harming riders or cargo.
4. Preserve the wagon for future use.
- **Full success**: gain 3 control points, may buy 1 more for 1 **fatigue**.
- **Partial success**: gain 1 point, may buy 2 more for 1 **fatigue** each. 
- Each step costs 1 point.

---

### **I Interrogate** – **Persuasion/Intimidation**

Extract information from a reluctant subject.
- **Full success**: ask 4 questions; GM must answer.
- **Partial success**: ask 2 questions and may ask 1 more for 1 **fatigue**. 
- Questions must concern facts known to the subject.
- GM may lie on exactly one answer; the rest must be truthful, though not always fully forthcoming.

---

## Other Mechanics

### Group Rolls

- In a **group roll**, each PC adds their dice for the relevant trait into one pool. Resolve as follows:
    1. PCs total their **fatigue**:
        - At **5 fatigue**, cancel 1 success.
        - At **8 fatigue**, cancel 2 successes.
        - At **10 fatigue**, cancel 3 successes.  
            Canceled successes are removed from the pool and can’t be used further. The group chooses which successes to cancel.
    2. Each 6 still counts as a success and removes one failure die from the pool.
    3. If successes outnumber failures → **the group succeeds**.
    4. If canceling a failure via a 6 creates a tie, compare repeated numbers: the side (successes or failures) with more repeated dice wins (e.g. three 3s beat two 6s and two 5s). If still tied, the PCs win.
    5. You can’t restore dice once canceled.
    6. If the outcome becomes obvious at any step, stop there.

---

### Opposed Tests

- When two characters contest each other (e.g. arm-wrestling), each rolls the appropriate trait.
- Whoever scores more successes wins; on a tie, the higher total pips wins.

---

### Conflict & Party Disagreements

- If one PC attempts something the others oppose (e.g. poisoning the queen), **pause the game**.
- As a team, talk through what to do—maintaining a healthy table dynamic is more important than the rules.
- If you can’t reach a decision everyone accepts, consider ending the campaign rather than playing in bad faith.
- Use this approach for any pivotal moment, not just direct conflicts.

---

### Exploration & Travel

- Outside of towns, PCs must each consume one ration per day or suffer **discomfort** from hunger.
- On overland journeys lasting days, you need one ration per person per day.

**On a difficult terrain “leg”** (snow, swamps, dense forest), once per day the group makes a **group Survival roll**: each PC adds their dice, then identify the most common face to determine results.
- The party’s chosen leader narrates the day’s events, weaving in successes, failures, and individual PC experiences in one-sentence snippets per PC plus a general summary.
- Example: *We were up to our knees in snow, and the wind was howling across the white horizon, making every step up the slope a struggle. Player A was the first to spot odd tracks alongside our own—either there were more of our quarry than we thought, or they’d linked up with someone else. Then our trapper, Player Trapper, pointed out a safer route over the ridges—the one the locals always take in winter—so we veered off that way, hoping it led to our target. Halfway up, Player C caught their foot on a buried root and went sprawling, losing their supplies in the snow. Luckily, Player D foraged some edible roots to keep us going. We thought the day might end without further trouble—until the snow gave way beneath Player E, sending them crashing down a cliff and smashing into a rocky ledge, tearing a chunk of muscle in their side. Between all of us we hauled them back up with rope and finally found shelter in a small cave. We shoved down our hardtack, braced ourselves—and then a blizzard blew in.*
- This narration is crucial—it builds a vivid story and fills each travel segment with real, unfolding events. Never leave it out.

**Outcome by most-common face:**

| Face | Success (party manages well)                                           | Failure (party struggles)                                                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6    | No trouble at all—gain 1 **fate** die.                                 | You blunder into predators. Prepare for an ambush.                                                 |
| 5    | Mental respite: remove 1 point of fatigue.                      | You lose a random item (roll d10 = occupied slots). Arcana can’t be lost—you’d notice immediately. |
| 4    | You spot useful clues—ask the GM one site-related question.            | You barely held up mentally—gain **UNCERTAIN** status.                                             |
| 3    | You learn the lay of the land—ask the GM one terrain-related question. | You’re too exhausted to rest tonight.                                                              |
| 2    | You forage successfully—not need to spend rations for this leg.        | You suffer an accident—gain **WOUNDED** status.                                                    |
| 1    | You stumble on a friendly NPC— you may ask them two questions.         | You narrowly survive—gain **MAULED** status.                                                       |


- If the terrain is easy or PCs know a safe route, skip this roll.

---

### Chase

1. The chase has as many **abstract segments** as there are PCs (e.g. City → Alley → Fence → Sewers).
2. Each segment is handled by a different PC, clockwise, starting from a random PC.
3. The guiding PC chooses the trait for the segment—reasonably tied to the situation (Performance to blend into a crowd, Sleight of Hand to snatch laundry lines, etc.). The GM can veto illogical choices.
4. The group then makes a **group roll** on that trait, with situational modifiers applied by the GM (–1 for unfamiliar terrain, +1 if wounded, etc.).
5. PCs may each use one “speed” power (teleport, flight, etc.) per segment. Using it costs 1 fatigue and can’t be reused.
6. If a combat trait is used (Melee, Aiming, Magic), winning that segment grants the next segment’s leader +1 die; losing removes 1 die next time.
7. The guiding PC narrates success or failure for that segment.
8. If the PCs win more segments than they lose, they catch their quarry or escape; if they lose more, they are caught. Ties trigger an extra deciding segment.

---

#### Quick Catch without Full Chase

- **Athletics**:
    - **Full success**: you catch the runner easily.
    - **Partial success**: choose:
        - You catch them but suffer a random physical status.
        - You catch them but the Social Clock advances.
- **Aiming**:
    - **Full success**: deal your full damage; if they survive, they’re unconscious.
    - **Partial success**: deal full damage; if they survive, they fall prone but:
        - They alert bystanders.
        - The Social Clock advances.

---

### Reputation

Before play begins, have players imagine they’re members of a royal court before the king. Would they risk mocking or insulting him? Certainly not. That’s how PCs should feel in this world: no plot armor, real consequences for offending powerful figures.

Track each faction or community’s attitude toward the PCs with a Reputation score, starting at **–1 (Stranger)**. You can also maintain a global Reputation if you like. Each shift in Reputation also carries over all effects of the previous levels.

|Level|Title|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|+5|Honored|The faction will grant any one request that doesn’t threaten its core interests.|
|+4|Esteemed|The faction will grant one limited request that doesn’t threaten its core interests.|
|+3|Influential|**Advantage** on all social rolls (Influence, Persuasion, Deception, etc.) and access to rare goods at the Market.|
|+2|Known|PCs spend money as if one Wealth level higher.|
|+1|Recognized|PCs may ask locals one reasonable question about the faction’s domain—no roll needed.|
|0|Neutral|No modifiers.|
|–1|Stranger|PCs spend money as if one Wealth level lower.|
|–2|Suspect|**Disadvantage** on all social rolls; Market use may be restricted.|
|–3|Distrusted|Additional **disadvantage**; no free lodging; healers refuse to help without cost.|
|–4|Hostile|PCs are banished or hunted within the faction’s territory, bounty offered for delivery to authorities.|
|–5|Enmity|PCs are hunted beyond faction borders, large bounty on their heads.|

&nbsp;

---

- **Unwitting service** (e.g. removing the faction’s quarry or aiding its interests) → Reputation +1.
- **Failed faction mission** → Reputation –1.
- **Mixed results** → Roll **Influence**: full success +1, partial no change, failure –1.
- **Directly opposing a faction’s interests** → Reputation –1.
    - Examples: murdering innocents, caught stealing, sabotaging a faction’s business, publicly denigrating its values or deities, mistreating ordinary citizens.

Gaining positive Reputation is intentionally challenging.

### Respecting Authority and Social Values

#### Types of Authority

Authority in this world comes in five tiers:
- **Natural** (e.g. instinct to survive)
- **Dominant** (king, emperor)
- **Privileged** (bishop, noble officer)
- **Executive** (city guard, tax collector)
- **Threatening** (bandit, criminal gang)

Whenever an authority issues an order that PCs refuse, they must roll **Influence** to resist. Higher tiers of authority impose stiffer consequences—even a full success can carry penalties.

If a PC has a strong, story-driven hate or moral objection to a particular authority, they gain **advantage** on Influence rolls against it. Likewise, prevailing goodwill or fear can impose **disadvantage**.

---

#### Open Hostility

If PCs openly defy or insult a faction’s core values—spitting on a holy altar, mocking the queen, etc.—they immediately lose **2 Reputation levels** with that faction and executive forces are summoned to apprehend them. If no guards are present, PCs may flee; refusal or failure to surrender when they arrive triggers combat.
- **If captured:** PCs are imprisoned, their gear is sold to pay bounties/compensation, and their Reputation toward that faction becomes **–4**.
- **If they escape:** they know their only safe option is to leave that faction’s jurisdiction; Reputation still becomes **–4**.

---

#### Natural Authority

When PCs attempt actions obviously opposed by basic survival instincts (mass slaughter in a fearful mob, sacrilege in the face of a fanatical crowd, etc.), the GM may invoke **Natural Authority**—their own bodies rebel. The GM can demand a **Will** roll:

| Risk Level               | Description                                                                | Roll              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **1. Minor Obstacle**    | shopkeeper pleads for life, a few onlookers                                | 1d6 vs. target 5+ |
| **2. Major Consequence** | guards will hunt you, mob will tear you apart, violates deeply held values | 2d6, need 11+     |
| **3. Extreme Risk**      | public magic in a magic-ban state, murder before the royal guard           | 3d6, need 17+     |

- **Failure:** the PC physically cannot proceed; they must try a different approach.
- **Success:** they carry on, but lose Reputation as the GM determines—and at risk levels 2 and 3 also gain 1 **madness point**.

---

#### Character-Consistency Rolls

If a PC attempts something wildly out of character (e.g. a virtuous priest torturing a prisoner), the GM may call for a **Will** roll:
- **6:** the PC does it, but gains a minor mental status.
- **4–5:** the PC does it, gains a mental status, and the GM may impose a narrative consequence (trauma, social rejection, etc.).
- **1–3:** internal resistance stops them—GM narrates their hesitation.

The player **may** choose to ignore this roll, but doing so grants 1 **madness point** automatically.

---

#### Influence Rolls by Authority Tier

1. **Against Dominant Authority** (king, emperor):
    - For example, when a guard orders PCs to bow before the king on the throne and they refuse, they must roll **Influence** before acting:
    - Immediate **–2 Reputation** and +1 **fatigue** on any open defiance.
    - **Full success:** you refuse; your confidence shakes them—but the entire group suffers **disadvantage** on social rolls in that territory until Reputation improves by at least 1.
    - **Partial success:** you refuse but are forcefully expelled or combat breaks out.
    - **Failure:** you comply with the order.
2. **Against Privileged Authority** (bishop, noble):
    - If, for instance, a bishop demands PCs show reverence in his temple and they crack a lewd joke, they must roll **Influence** before speaking:
    - Immediate **–1 Reputation** and +1 **fatigue** for open defiance.
    - **Full success:** you refuse; they bristle but grudgingly tolerate you.
    - **Partial success:** you refuse; you’re immediately driven out or face combat.
    - **Failure:** you comply.
3. **Against Executive Authority** (guards, tax collectors):
    - If a guard orders PCs to lay down arms at the castle gate and they refuse, they roll **Influence**:
    - No automatic Reputation loss unless you show outright disrespect. Otherwise, refusing costs **–1 Reputation**.
    - **Full success:** you stand your ground; the officer hesitates and may refer you upward.
    - **Partial success:** you refuse but they call reinforcements or demand a bribe/pay a penalty.
    - **Failure:** you comply.
4. **Against Threatening Authority** (bandits, thugs):
    - If five cutthroats surround PCs in a tavern and demand compliance, they must roll **Influence**:
    - No Reputation penalty—this is raw coercion.
    - **Full success:** you refuse; they lose nerve, and you gain **advantage** on social rolls against them.
    - **Partial success:** you stall them—gain one chance to escape before you must comply.
    - **Failure:** you comply and go along, though you can scheme later to escape.

_Use these mechanics to keep authority meaningful and to protect the narrative from PCs deliberately derailing the story._

## Crafting

### Alchemy

PCs can create potions. To do so, they must:
- Spend a **component**.
- Spend one downtime action.
- Roll on Arcana:
    - **Critical success** (double sixes): you may create an **arcane item**—work out its details with the GM.
    - **Full success**: you successfully brew a potion of your choice.
    - **Partial success**: choose one
        - You succeed, but randomly determine which potion you created.
        - Or you choose which potion to create, but you suffer a random **physical** and **mental** status.
    - **Failure**: the brewing fails, the **component** is wasted, you gain a **mental** status, and take **1d20** damage.
- PCs can create **Jaruga’s Wonders** in the same way as potions.
- Any **critical failure** (two ones) advances the **Corruption Clock**.
- Any **critical success** (two sixes) produces a potion combining the effects of two chosen potions.
- PCs and the GM, collaborating, may design **custom** potions; they should function mechanically like those on the standard list.

---

### Herbalism / Apothecary

PCs can create **medical items**. To do so, they must:
- Declare the intent during a long rest (they recover **2 less** fatigue that rest).
- Spend a **resource**.
- Roll on Herbalism/Apothecary:
    - **Critical success**: you combine two chosen effects without paying their normal costs.
    - **Full success**: you successfully craft a chosen medical item.
    - **Partial success**: choose one
        - You succeed, but randomly determine which medical item you created.
        - Or you choose which **decoction** to make, but you suffer a random **mental** status.
    - **Failure**: the crafting fails, the **resource** is wasted, you gain a **mental** status, and take **1d20** damage.
- PCs can create **decoctions** in the same way as medical items.
- Any **critical failure** (two ones) advances the **Corruption Clock**.
- Any **critical success** (two sixes) produces a decoction that either combines two chosen effects or has no side effects.
- PCs and the GM may design **custom** decoctions; they should function mechanically like those on the standard list.

---

### Crafting Technology

PCs can create **tactical gear**. To do so, they must:
- Declare the intent during a long rest (they recover **2 less** fatigue that rest).
- Spend a **material**.
- Roll on Technology:
    - **Critical success**: you combine two chosen gear effects without paying their normal costs.
    - **Full success**: you successfully craft a chosen piece of tactical gear.
    - **Partial success**: choose one
        - You succeed, but randomly determine which gear you created.
        - Or you choose which gear to make, but you suffer a random **physical** status.
    - **Failure**: the crafting fails, the **material** is wasted, you gain a **physical** status, and take **1d20** damage.
- PCs can craft ordinary utility items (shovel, rope, etc.) exactly as they craft tactical gear—but on a partial success they always choose the item created and suffer a random **physical** status.
- PCs can repair weapons, armor, or items exactly as they craft tactical gear—but:
    - On a partial success they choose which item is repaired and suffer a random **physical** status.
    - It costs one downtime action instead of a long rest.
- Any **critical failure** (two ones) advances the **Corruption Clock** (due to electrical surges or chemical backlash).
- Any **critical success** (two sixes) produces tactical gear that either has two uses instead of one or yields two copies of the same item.
- PCs and the GM may design **custom** tactical gear; it should function mechanically like items on the standard list.

---

## Interactive Elements

### Traps

- Traps are placed to kill or effectively stop intruders. They should inspire terror, so they must always be lethal or impose status effects.
- PCs roll **Investigation** to detect a trap only if they explicitly declare they’re looking for one.
    - **Partial success** – the PC notices a trap but can’t deduce how it works.
        - e.g. “You see a metal plate riddled with holes; you know there’s a mechanism underneath that could trigger something dangerous, but you can’t tell what.”
    - **Full success** – the PC notices the trap and understands roughly how it functions and what to do.
        - e.g. “You expect poisonous gas to seep from those holes.”
- Every trap deals **1d20** damage and/or imposes a status.
- To attempt disarmament, the PC must describe a logical method for neutralizing the threat.
- The GM may grant **advantage** if the proposed method is truly convincing.
- PCs may use any appropriate **trait**—for example, **Athletics** to physically dismantle it.
    - **Partial success** – the PC disarms the trap but suffers **2 fatigue**.
    - **Failure** – the trap is triggered and the PC takes **disadvantage** on their saving roll against its effect.
- The saving roll to avoid a trap’s effect uses a fitting trait (e.g. a gas trap calls for an **Endurance** check; a guillotine for **Dexterity**).
    - **Full success** – the PC weathers the effect as well as possible and draws one physical or mental status (depending on the trap).
    - **Partial success** – the PC partly resists: either draws one physical or mental status (their choice) or takes **1d20** damage.
    - **Failure** – the PC suffers catastrophic effects: draws one physical or mental status (depending on the trap) and takes **1d20** damage.
- Even on a full success against a trap you trigger, the PC still suffers something—usually **fatigue** to represent the shock.
- The GM can warn PCs that a trap has potentially catastrophic consequences. After such a warning, you aren’t obliged to hold back from removing a limb or worse if they fail their roll.

---

### Riddles / Puzzles

- If PCs have no idea how to solve a riddle or puzzle the GM has set, they may attempt to overcome it with a **group test** on **Mind**.
    - If they succeed, they earn one clue for each **6** rolled.
    - If they fail, each PC gains **1 fatigue** and may inadvertently trigger any trap the puzzle conceals.

---

## End of Session

At the end of the session, each player says how their character feels about what has happened.  
Never skip this step!

Each player receives 2 advancement points.

One person—going around the table—volunteers to write, in bullet points, what happened and add it, with the date, to your shared online journal that everyone can view.

## For the GM – How to Run

### Allow PCs to Participate in Creating World Details  –

When you present the world, leave space for a player to expand it by asking questions such as:
- What’s the strangest thing you see in this tavern?
- How does your character know this NPC?
- Why does this place inspire fear in you?
- What does this remind you of from your childhood?

---

### How to Build an NPC  –

- **What do they want?** – one clear objective
- **What do they look like?** – one sentence, including a distinctive trait (e.g. they keep scratching the back of their neck)
- **What is one weakness you can exploit?** – one sentence

### Building Tension

- The world often works against the PCs. Tension rises. Time is running out. It gets harder. Will we make it? How much slack do we have left? The mechanics collected here help the GM foster a real sense of pressure and consequence.
- They all operate on the principle of **clocks**.

#### Clocks – what are they?

- Every action has consequences. Clocks measure their progress, for example:
    - the number of people the PCs must convince to change their mind in order to truly influence the social situation.
    - how many failures the PCs can suffer before someone realizes they’ve broken into the judge’s house.
    - how many of the boss’s weak points the PCs have wounded.
    - how close the bounty hunters are to finding the PCs who have warrants out.
    - how many rests the PCs can take in the dungeon before the beast finds them.
    - how many successes the PCs need to escape a trap in time.
- A clock can have as many points as needed—typically no fewer than 4 and no more than 8.
- The GM decides by how many points the PCs’ actions or events advance the clock.
- The GM decides whether the clock is public or hidden. It can also be semi-public: the PCs don’t know the total, but the GM informs them whenever it moves.

#### Sample Clock Mechanics

##### Immediate Pressure

- Each successive turn imposes **fatigue**.
- At the start of each turn, the GM rolls 1d6—on a 1, time has run out.
- Every round, the boss’s base damage increases by 1.
- You may take only as many actions before capture as you rolled successes.
- Each failure advances the clock by 1—every mistake costs a second.
- If the PCs don’t gather 3 full successes in 5 rounds, they fail to escape the collapsing tower.

##### Clocks in Combat

- PCs are defending someone—if that person is struck by ten enemy failures, they die.
- If enemies burn down four houses, the entire village the PCs vowed to save goes up in flames.
- Each round without resolving the threat prompts the GM to roll 1d6—on a 4+, a new enemy arrives.
- The boss cannot be killed until the clock fills—you must expose its weak point first.
- PCs must destroy ritual totems before the clock fills—otherwise the enemy regenerates.
- The longer the fight drags on, the more foes arrive. Each round advances the clock; at full, reinforcements show up.
- The more hits the boss takes, the stronger its final form becomes.
- The boss has a devastating attack—each PC failure advances its recharge clock.

##### Social Clocks

- The number of transgressions—insults, disrespect, value violations—before the community turns hostile.
- The number of debate successes required to earn the king’s trust.
- How many lies you can tell before someone starts fact-checking.
- How many questions you can ask before bystanders see through your disguise.
- How many alliance-breaking messages can reach a neighbor before cooperation collapses.
- How many diplomatic failures will ruin the plan.

##### Passage of Time

- After three in-game hours (accelerated by short rests), night falls and the PCs may uncover a secret visible only in moonlight.
- How many scenes the PCs can resolve before it’s too late to reach an important event.
- How many long rests before the PCs fail to reach the erupting volcano.
- How many noisy incidents the PCs must leave behind before bounty hunters catch up.
- How many units the PCs must recruit before they’re ready to retake the temple from invaders.

#### During Exploration

- How long the PCs can stay in a magic-tainted zone before it affects them.
- How many **Survival** test failures before they become truly lost.
- How many real-time minutes they can spend underwater before running out of air.
- Each rest in the desert restores one fewer point of **fatigue**.
- How many successes they need to survive a night in the wild without consequences.
- How close they are to discovering a secret path—each full success advances the clock.
- How long they can make noise in the ruins before waking something best left asleep.
- How many clues they must gather to locate a hidden dungeon entrance.
- How many times they can use the same makeshift crossing before it collapses into the river.
- How many turns they can spend disarming a trap before the mechanism triggers.

---

### Building Fights as the GM

- When you as the GM find yourself needing to quickly prepare an encounter, or simply looking for inspiration, you can use the ready-made patterns and tables below to build a dynamic, engaging, and memorable challenge for the PCs on the fly.
- The following fight types don’t cover every possibility, but show how to stage many common scenarios.

#### Fight Types

##### 1. Defense

- **Goal:** Hold out for X rounds, defend an NPC/object/location, escort something across the map.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Enemies attack in waves.
    - If they score X hits on the NPC/object, the PCs lose.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the defended object takes 2 hits.

**Examples:**
- Defending a caravan from bandits.
- Guarding a magical ritual from interruption.
- Holding a bridge until reinforcements arrive.

---

##### 2. Difficult Terrain

- **Goal:** Win the fight in harsh environmental conditions.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers a terrain hazard: lava splashes from a geyser, you slip on ice, you get tangled in thorny vines, etc.
    - PCs may use **Athletics** to shove enemies into hazards; enemies can do the same.
    - Certain zones are dangerous: entering or starting your turn there forces a saving throw (appropriate trait). Failure imposes a random physical or mental status; partial success lets you pay **fatigue** to avoid it.
- Often combined with other fight types.

**Examples:**
- A battle among erupting steam vents.
- Falling into a trap in a mountain ravine.

---

##### 3. Escape

- **Goal:** Get away instead of defeating the foe.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Each turn, players earn Escape Points from their rolls:
        - 1 point for a partial success
        - 2 points for a full success
    - If they reach X points before time runs out, they escape.
    - Current total and required total are public.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you stumble, lose an item, or lose 2 Escape Points.

**Examples:**
- Breaking out of a prison before the guards lock the doors.
- Racing out of a burning building.

---

##### 4. Domination

- **Goal:** Seize and hold a key position.
- **Mechanics:**
    - There’s a control area—PCs must drive all enemies out.
    - Enemies attack in waves; if they push the PCs out, the PCs lose.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** summons another enemy.

**Examples:**
- Taking the guard tower during a siege.
- Holding a choke point in a canyon.

---

##### 5. Time Pressure

- **Goal:** Stop something from finishing (e.g. a ritual).
- **Mechanics:**
    - The GM rolls 1d6 each round—on a 1, the event completes.
    - Or each round every PC takes 1 **fatigue**.
    - Or each PC failure advances the end-of-event clock by 1.
    - To interrupt the event, PCs must destroy/neutralize X specific objects or people.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** either advances the clock or re-triggers another aspect of this encounter’s mechanics.

**Examples:**
- Preventing the necromancer from raising an undead army.
- Closing a portal before a monster crosses through.

---

##### 6. Destruction

- **Goal:** Destroy something rather than fight to the last.
- **Mechanics:**
    - The object needs X hit successes to break.
    - Enemies try to stop the PCs from reaching their objective.
    - PCs can use the environment (chop down a pillar onto a statue) to add hits.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means someone reinforces or repairs the target, forcing +2 extra hits.

**Examples:**
- Collapsing a cavern pillar to bring down the ceiling.
- Burning all the key documents in a fortress.

---

##### 7. Boss Fight

- **Goal:** Defeat an exceptionally powerful foe with special phases.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Phases:** Every X hits on the boss triggers a new phase or ability.
    - **Weak Points:** Each boss has one weak spot per phase, revealed by a full success in **Perception** or relevant lore.
    - **Special Attacks:** Every X rounds or PC failures, the boss unleashes a devastating move.
    - Each round the boss’s base damage increases by 1.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** advances the boss’s special-attack clock or grants an extra action.

**Examples:**

- Two smaller foes merging into one, then splitting again.
- A golem empowered by runes—destroy the runes one by one to weaken it.

---

##### 8. Hunt / Invisible Foes

- **Goal:** Track and defeat a foe before it escapes.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Tracking:** Each turn PCs roll **Perception**, collecting points: 1 for a partial success, 2 for a full success. If the foe gathers X points, it escapes or hides successfully
    - Invisible foes can mislead PCs—luring them with sounds—forcing further **Perception** checks and boosting their escape chances.
    - Hidden foes may ambush and then vanish or leave traps.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** increases the foe’s escape-point requirement by 2.
    - If the foe fails to escape, each X points PCs gather can translate into a surprise attack on it.

**Examples:**
- Hunting a demon that phases between shadows.
- Chasing a fleeing assassin who misleads trackers.

---

##### 9. Combat in Motion

- **Goal:** Fight while moving—on a wagon, train, horse chase, or moving platforms.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Any failure risks a fall unless you pay **fatigue**.
    - If an attack achieves at least half successes on all dice, the target falls unless they pay fatigue.
    - Falling may remove you from combat; fights can drag on until fatigue runs out.
    - **Shifting battlefield:** Every 2 rounds the terrain shifts (a carriage uncouples, platforms move).
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** triggers another terrain shift.
    - X full successes smooth out the terrain and reduce fall risk.

**Examples:**
- A duel atop a flying giant snake.
- Battle across swaying chandeliers.

---

##### 10. Chaos in a Crowd

- **Goal:** Precise action amid random elements—more than just foes.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means you collide with the panicked crowd and fall.
    - If you fall, you make an **Endurance** check to withstand trampling. Partial success – 2 damage; failure – 4 damage.
    - All attacks and spells have **disadvantage**—hard to aim or cast gestures.
    - An attack failure kills a random bystander; after X such deaths, the crowd turns on the PCs.
    - Changing zones requires a **Dexterity** check to push through the crowd; failure means you’re carried one zone away by the mob.

**Examples:**
- A melee in a crowded market where bystanders impede combat.
- Fighting amid a stampede.

---

##### 11. Illusion Combat

- **Goal:** Identify the real threat among illusions and false copies.
- **Mechanics:**
    - A full success in **Perception** dispels one illusion—you can attempt this as an action.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** multiplies the illusions, increasing identification difficulty.
    - Failing an attack gives **disadvantage** next turn due to confusion.
    - Each illusion has 6 HP.

**Examples:**
- A mage duel where the foe creates copies of themselves.
- A hall of mirrors.

---

##### 12. Severing Power

- **Goal:** Weaken the foe by separating them from their source of power.
- **Mechanics:**
    - PCs need X points from **Athletics** or **Sleight of Hand** to damage the power source enough to break it. Partial success grants 1 point, full success 2 points.
    - Rolling a 1 on the **main die** means the foe temporarily strengthens the link—PCs must earn an extra 2 points.
    - A full success in **Perception** or **Arcana** (as an action) reveals one of three weak links; destroying one requires a full success and immediately grants 4 points toward severing. After all three are destroyed, the link breaks regardless of current points.
    - Until the link is severed, the foe may be effectively immortal or too resilient for direct damage to be optimal.

**Examples:**
- Fighting a knight whose strength comes from a relic in his armor.
- Confronting a child possessed by a demon—you don’t want to hurt the child.

---

#### Fight Tables

###### How to Use the Tables

- The GM rolls 4×d12 to determine **Fight Type, Hazard, Opportunity,** and **Modifier**.
- Combine them into one description and tailor to your world.
- Lay out combat zones so environmental elements matter.

###### 1. Fight Type (d12)

|Roll|Encounter Type|
|---|---|
|1|**Defense** – you must protect something/someone for X rounds.|
|2|**Difficult Terrain** – the scenery itself is the challenge.|
|3|**Escape** – you must get out before you’re overwhelmed.|
|4|**Domination** – seize and hold a position.|
|5|**Time Pressure** – the fight ends when something completes.|
|6|**Destruction** – you must destroy an objective instead of defeating all enemies.|
|7|**Boss Fight** – one powerful foe with unique abilities.|
|8|**Hunt/Invisible Foes** – enemies aren’t visible or must be tracked down.|
|9|**Combat in Motion** – on a train roof, moving platforms, horse chase, etc.|
|10|**Chaos in a Crowd** – random obstacles and civilians complicate the fight.|
|11|**Illusion Combat** – not everything you see is real.|
|12|**Severing Power** – fight a friend possessed or a mage linked to an external power source.|

###### 2. Hazard (d12)

|Roll|Hazard|
|---|---|
|1|**Slippery/Icy Ground** – rolling 1–2 on the main die means you fall.|
|2|**Thick Fog/Smoke** – certain zones impose **Blinded** and **disadvantage** on ranged/magical attacks from outside.|
|3|**Collapsing Structure/Falling Debris** – rolling a 1 on the main die deals **fatigue** from impact or knocks you down (PC’s choice).|
|4|**Dense Foliage** – any failure costs you your movement next turn; on full success you can impose that effect on enemies instead.|
|5|**Poisonous Fumes** – anyone who remains in the zone gains **fatigue** each round.|
|6|**Spiked Pit/Brambles** – you must jump across; falling imposes the **WOUNDED** status.|
|7|**Storm/High Winds** – **disadvantage** on ranged attacks; rolling a 1 on the main die blows you into an adjacent zone in the wind’s direction.|
|8|**Destructible Cover** – must be destroyed by a full success on an attack roll to expose enemies.|
|9|**Indestructible Barriers** – parts of the arena are inaccessible or shift during combat.|
|10|**Fire** – contact calls for a Dexterity save; failure imposes **BURNED**.|
|11|**Unstable Ground/Earthquake** – rolling a 1 causes the ground beneath you to split; everyone in that zone must move to a neighboring zone, which becomes impassable (see pit above).|
|12|**Fragile Point** – certain map features (e.g. a powder keg) risk catastrophic chain reactions (e.g. d20 explosion).|

###### 3. Opportunity (d12)

|Roll|Clever Ways to Gain the Upper Hand|
|---|---|
|1|**Hanging Chandelier/Boulder** – can be dropped on foes.|
|2|**Lever/Mechanism** – closes doors or cuts off enemies.|
|3|**Hidden Passage** – a secret corridor or door allows quick repositioning or flanking.|
|4|**Barrels of Gunpowder** – ignite for an explosion.|
|5|**Caged Beast** – release it to attack the nearest creature.|
|6|**Unstable Structure** – collapse a bridge or roof under enemies.|
|7|**Reflective Surface** – a mirror or polished metal can redirect ranged attacks.|
|8|**Scattered Weapons/Tools** – pick up makeshift arms.|
|9|**Enemies May Surrender** – intimidation or persuasion could end the fight.|
|10|**Controlled Explosions** – trigger part of the terrain for advantage.|
|11|**Magical Anomaly** – random effect each round ripe for exploitation.|
|12|**Shadows & Camouflage** – hide and strike from stealth.|

###### 4. Fight Modifier (d12)

|Roll|Something That Alters the Fight|
|---|---|
|1|**Add one new enemy each round.**|
|2|**Enemies are buffed**—a magical or mutated enhancement protected by certain units.|
|3|**Special Enemy**—one opponent has a devastating attack whose recharge clock advances on PC failures.|
|4|**High Armor**—enemies need extra successes to take damage.|
|5|**Enemies wield arcane magic** that weakens PCs.|
|6|**Enemies wield weapons that impose status effects.**|
|7|**One enemy is the key target**—defeating it ends the fight.|
|8|**Endless waves**—must find a way to break out of the map (e.g. open a gate).|
|9|**Mounted Foes**—faster, stronger opponents on steeds.|
|10|**Special gear**—e.g. grappling-hook pistols.|
|11|**Organized Units**—enemies operate as squads.|
|12|**High Ground**—enemies occupy elevated zones and rely on ranged or firearm attacks.|

###### Zone Effects

- Most zones should influence the fight. You can choose or roll zones and their effects from the table below to quickly diversify the encounter.
- Zone effects stack.

|#|Zone Name|Effect|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
